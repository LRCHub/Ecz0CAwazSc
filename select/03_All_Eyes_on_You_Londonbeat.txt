It's Monday morning - You tumble out of bed
Your job is boring - It's doin' your head
Leave off your make-up - Who's gonna' notice?
You're non-personna all week long

Bridge 1:
It's the weekend - -You're picking up your wages
It's the weekend - you're coming out of your shell

1:
All Eyes On You - When you hit the dance-floor
All Eyes On You and I fall in love
Your ev'ry move sets temperatures to risin'
You've got the moves - All Eyes on You

Back at the office you're all they talk about
Oh Lucky Lady - You made the grade
You danced your way up to fortune and fame
Now ev'rybody seems to know your name

Bridge 2:
It's the weekend - I'm pickin' up my wages
It's the weekend - I'm comin' back for more

2:
All Eyes On You - When you hit the dance-floor
All Eyes On You and I fall in love
Your ev'ry move sets temperatures to risin'
All Eyes on You and I fall in love

Middle - 8:
Never get enough of the stuff you're dealin'
The way you give it up girl it's sho' nuff healin' me

Bridge 3:
It's the weekend - I'm pickin' up my wages
It's the weekend - I'm comin' back for more, more, more
(More)
3:
All Eyes On You - When you hit the dance-floor
All Eyes On You and I fall in love
Your ev'ry move sets temperatures to risin'
You've got the moves - All Eyes on You

Repeat to fade
