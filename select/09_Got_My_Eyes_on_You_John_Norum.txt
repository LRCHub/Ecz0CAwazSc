You really got something going, you really got a hold on me
Boil it down to perfection, seem to come naturally
You're kicking my heart in motion, everytime you walk in view
You trigger that sweet emotion, I can't get over you
Come take this trip with me
I got my eyes on you, anything you want me to
Anything to make you see, come on and lay your love on me
You really got my senses reeling, you can make a grown man cry
Girl, I wanna trust the feeling, yeah, I wanna testify
Flames are getting higher and higher, I could feel it from the start
I just wanna build a fire, with every beat of my heart
Come do this thing with me
I got my eyes on you, anything you want me to
Anything to make you see, come on and lay your love on me
I got my eyes on you, anything you want me to
Anything to make you see, come on and lay your love on me
I got my eyes on you, anything you want me to
Anything to make you see, come on and lay your love on me
I got my eyes on you, anything you want me to
Anything to make you see, come on and lay your love on me
Oh yeah, lay your love on me, lay your love on me
