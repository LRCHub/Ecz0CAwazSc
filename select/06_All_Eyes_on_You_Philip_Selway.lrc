[00:25.78] ...and you're invited to
[00:33.84] The chance of a lifetime interview.
[00:42.99] Slow down and breathe.
[00:52.82] Slow down, you're terrified to speak!
[01:11.32] 
[01:06.45] All Eyes on You.
[01:14.45] 
[01:11.88] ...and you're embarrassed, too.
[01:25.45] Afraid of the light that shines on you.
[01:44.95] 
[01:34.53] So frail and small.
[01:44.53] So scared, you're terrified by all
[01:57.18] The eyes on you.
[02:05.18] 
[02:00.85] All Eyes on You.
